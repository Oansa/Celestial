# Celestial – Your AI Companion for Space Exploration

**Welcome to Celestial**,
An AI agent custom-built to assist astronauts in deep space expeditions. Whether on the Moon, Mars, or beyond, Celestial is designed to serve as your intelligent, always-alert co-astronaut.



##  What Powers Celestial?

* **YOLOv8 by Ultralytics**:
  Empowers Celestial with cutting-edge computer vision, enabling real-time environmental awareness, object detection, and visual interpretation in unfamiliar planetary terrain.

* **Ollama's LLM Integration**:
  Provides natural language capabilities, allowing astronauts to interact with Celestial using spoken language. This means hands-free, voice-activated logic and assistance — ideal for space missions.



##  How It Works

Celestial stays online and operates in **idle mode** by constantly monitoring and capturing data from its surroundings.

Upon a user prompt, for example, when an astronaut asks a question, Celestial processes the input alongside current environmental visuals to deliver an informed, context-aware response. It can also capture new images on request to enhance its understanding of the scene.



##  Use Case: A Co-Astronaut on Mars

Celestial is engineered with one bold ambition: **to be deployed in interplanetary missions** particularly Mars and the Moon.

### Key Functions:

* **Astronaut Health Monitoring**: Keep tabs on vital signs and alert in case of anomalies.
* **Real-time Navigation Assistance**: Guide crews through uncharted environments with confidence.
* **Hazard Detection**: Warn astronauts about environmental threats like dust storms or radiation spikes.
* **Planetary Intelligence**: Act as a knowledge base for newly discovered elements and terrain.
* **On-demand Analysis**: From soil scans to alien tech (we’re hopeful!), Celestial will observe, analyze, and report.

> One mind. All the data. Full safety and reliability for humans in space. That’s Celestial.



##  The Future of Celestial

We envision Celestial as:

* The **central hub** for space exploration data.
* An autonomous system to **govern space activities**, including:

  * Building extraterrestrial infrastructure
  * Enhancing habitability on foreign planets
  * Supporting space mining operations
  * Managing crewed missions safely 
  * Harnessing new methods of generating Energy on Mars
* A guide to enhancing organism's characteristics to improve rate of survival on Mars and the Moon, i.e: Engage in biohacking activities    that aim to improve the sustainability of human, plant and animal species on Mars.

With Celestial, humanity takes a leap closer to **thriving beyond Earth**.
